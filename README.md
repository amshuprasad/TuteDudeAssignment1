<!-- Assignemt-1,Task-1 -->
This program asks the user to input two numbers and then performs basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It also includes error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.

1. A function called math_operations that takes two parameters: num1 and num2.
2. + operator Adds the two numbers and prints the result.
3. - operator Subtracts num2 from num1 and prints the result.
4. * operator multiplies num2 from num1 and prints the result.
5. For division - This checks if num2 is not zero.If it's not zero, it performs the division and prints the result.If num2 is zero, it prints an error message to avoid a division-by-zero crash.
